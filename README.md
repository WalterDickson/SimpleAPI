# SimpleAPI
A simple api request for the sunrise/sunset information of a specific date and location. (latitude/longitude)

Created a swift based app that sends a request to sunride-sunset.org that displays the provided data of sunrises and sunsets.

### This app utilizes basic uikit objects:
- Labels that display the sunrise and sunset info<br>
- A Button that sends a request for the latitude, longitude, & date that the user controls via textfields & a date picker<br>
- Styling changes for textfields, a button, a pickerview, & labels
